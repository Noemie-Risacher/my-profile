      <h2>Food 🍽️</h2>
      <p>My very first passion is food. In fact, what I love most of all is eating. I'm not fussy when it comes to food, and one of my dreams is to be able to taste every speciality in the world at least once. Pizza and sushi are two things I could never live without, but my favorite food is Vietnamese. With egg rolls, spring rolls, Ban Xiao, Bò Bún, Phở and lots of other specialties.</p>

      <h2>Series and movies 🍿</h2>
      <p>I've seen countless series, some of which I still haven't finished, but my favorites remain Breaking Bad, How to get away with a Murder, The Handmaid's Tale and Sons of Anarchy. I also started getting interested in Korean dramas after finishing Uncontrollably Fond. And after discovering the Korean film "Parasite", I've watched a lot of Korean films, including The Handmaiden and Memories of Murder, which are both favorites.</p>

      <h2>Japanese culture 🇯🇵</h2>
      <p>I'm a huge fan of Japanese culture. The food, traditions and history of Japan are all things that fascinate me. Manga like One Piece, Naruto and Dragon Ball were part of my childhood and now I'm a huge manga and anime fan.</p>
